# map-bot
RAISE project to create a ML model that can create maps based on speech/text


## The Plan: ##
1. Generate text using tracery
2. Construct an svg generator to draw based off constructed text
3. Pair descriptions with svgs and use them to train a model
4. The model should be able to draw a shortlist of objects
