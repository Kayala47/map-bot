# To-do List
As of 6/11/2020

## Generating Images and Text
- rectangles not appearing at all
- add curves to rivers
- change rivers/roads to be their own separate grammar, taking in start & endpts
- change generation so that it accepts x,y locations
- the code that I added to make sure shapes wouldn't go outside of the image is causing some to appear in in appropriate locations. It probably results from the inconstencies in how certain shapes determine their origin.

## ML
- ask Prof. Osborne about next steps
